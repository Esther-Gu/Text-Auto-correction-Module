# Text Auto-correction Module

## Introduction

The Text Analytics and Autocorrection Module is a Python-based program aimed at measuring typing speed and implementing a typing autocorrect feature. The module performs text classification tasks, keyword matching, and provides real-time analytics for typing speed and accuracy.

This project was created as part of online coursework at [UC Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su20/proj/cats/).

## Features

### Text Classification
- Achieves up to 90% accuracy in classifying text into various categories.
- Utilizes basic natural language processing techniques.

### Autocorrection
- Implements dynamic programming and edit distance algorithms.
- Optimized for fast execution using memoization techniques.

### Typing Metrics
- Real-time calculation of Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy.
- Multiplayer progress tracking and competitive typing metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Dynamic Programming
- Edit Distance Algorithms
- Memoization
